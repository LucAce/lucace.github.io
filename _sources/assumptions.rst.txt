Assumptions and Warnings
========================

Warnings
~~~~~~~~

The following are warnings that apply to the cluster and/or all guides.

..

  1. **Do Not Expose These Systems or Services To The Internet**

  These guides assume that the cluster will be on an isolated subnet within a
  larger organization and will utilize additional security monitoring tools
  that are beyond the scope of these guides.  These guides do not provide
  hardening techniques for exposing them to the internet.

..

  2. **Use Trusted Certificates**

  These guides utilize self signed certificates for TLS encryption.  Self signed
  certificates are suspectable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attacks and should
  not be considered secure.  It is recommended that certificates be issued by
  an internal or reputable Certificate Authority (CA).  Keep in mind that most
  Certificate Authorities publish recently issued certificates to
  Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and you should not use sensitive server
  names. |br| |br|

..

  3. **Implement a Backup Strategy**

  These guides do not cover backing up of the cluster.  Backups and restoration
  strageties is a required element to a cluster.  RAID is not a backup.

..

  4. **Implement a Redundancy/Resilancy Strategy**

  These guides only provide techniquies for improving fault tolernace such as
  providing RAID on systems.  Redundancy strageties is a required element to
  a cluster.


Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The guides make a couple fundamental assumptions which have guided how things were
implemented.  Anyone implementing these systems will need to evaluate their specific
requirements and tailor them for their specific usage scenarios.

..

  1. The hosted applications are run on separate virtual machines and do not utilize Docker.
  While Docker is one of the provided applications, its usage is intended for internally
  developed and deployed images only.  This limitation is in place to eliminate the
  need for third-party image hosting.  Source code and RPMs for applications should be
  accessed directly from the developer.

..

  2. Yum/DNF repositories are utilized, if available.  To reduce friction in performing
  updates yum repositories provided by the application authors have been utilized.
  Only in cases where repositories are not available (e.g. Slurm) are they not
  used.  While updates require coordination with users, utilizing the vendor repositories
  and yum/dnf commands to execute updates reduces the amount of work required.

..

  3. The cluster does not require a specific uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA).  These
  guides are intended to be used in an environment that can tolerate modest down times and
  system unavailability.  While down time should be cordinated with users, unexpected
  down time should not result in downtime of critical corporate resources.
