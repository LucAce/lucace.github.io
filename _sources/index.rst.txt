Engineering Workstation Cluster Deployment Guide
================================================

This site is a collection of guides on how to deploy a small cluster of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux based systems.  The cluster's design is intended to meet the
needs of a wide group of use cases but generally tailored towards engineering
workloads.  These guides started out as just a means to document how a cluster
was created but have been published so that others can benefit.

The guides cover an example hardware layout, how to install the operating systems,
and how to deploy an application on that system.  It is impossible to anticipate
every use and deployment scenario but the guides do provide a viable solution.
Guiding assumptions and overall warnings are listed in the assumptions section.

Work In Progress

Some of the guides still need to be written:

- Graylog
- Repository Mirror
- (All) Usage Guides
