The following instructions are for configuring a user account to use passwordless
SSH when IdM is used.  The instructions can be performed on any user accessible
system (User or Compute) after their user account and home directory have been
created.

This guide can be incorporated into new user accounts process and only needs to be
executed once by the user.

Deployment Steps

.. important::

  Instructions are to be executed by the user from their NFS mounted home directory.

.. important::

  "PubkeyAuthentication" must be enabled in ``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` for passwordless
  SSH to operate.  Deploying the IdM Client will enable this feature.

.. important::

  In order for the Slurm job scheduler to work correctly, passwordless ssh must use empty passphrases.

1. Generate public/private RSA key pair:

  .. code-block:: bash

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

2. Copy Public key to Authorized Keys:

  .. code-block:: bash

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

3. Disable Strict Host Key Checking:

  .. code-block:: bash

    cat >> ~/.ssh/config <<EOL
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    EOL

4. Ensure proper permissions on files:

  .. code-block:: bash

    chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    touch     ~/.ssh/known_hosts
    chmod 644 ~/.ssh/known_hosts
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh

5. Upload Public Key to IdM / FreeIPA

  .. code-block:: bash

    ipa user-mod ${USER} --sshpubkey="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"
