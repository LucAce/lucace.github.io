The following instructions are for deploying GitLab.


*************
Prerequisites
*************

This guide is written for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 based operating system which
is operating within a cluster of systems and the following are the prerequisites:

* :doc:`gitlab-os-installation-guide`
* :doc:`../idm/idm-client-deployment-guide`
* :doc:`../nfs/nfs-client-deployment-guide`

If deploying as a standalone service, adjust the hostname fields accordingly and
omit steps involving IdM, NFS, and follow-on deployment guides.


*********************
Follow-on Deployments
*********************

The following guides can be applied after the deployment of their associated nodes.

* :doc:`../graylog/rsyslog-deployment-guide`
* :doc:`../influxdb/telegraf-deployment-guide`

..

  These instructions were written for and tested on GitLab Community Edition (CE) ``15.11.3``.

..

  Instructions are based on the following documentation: |br|
  https://about.gitlab.com/install/#almalinux-8
  https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/nginx.html#manually-configuring-https


***************
Post Deployment
***************

..

  The GitLab can be accessed at the following URL: |br|
  https://gitlab.engwsc.example.com

  Username: ``root`` |br|
  Password (In File): ``/etc/gitlab/initial_root_password``


******************
Deployment Scripts
******************

.. note::

  An example bash script of the instructions has been provided: |br|
  :download:`../_static/gitlab/deploy-gitlab.sh`


****************
Deployment Notes
****************

..

  GitLab can be installed using the official Omnibus RPM file or by
  configuring the system to use the Omnibus package repository.  Either
  way is acceptable but it is not recommended that the package repository
  be enabled by default.  Updating GitLab every time the system is updated
  can introduce unintended changes that can break GitLab.

  When GitLab is updated, any changes to the ``/opt/gitlab/etc/gitlab.rb.template``
  template file must be manually merged into GitLab's configuration file
  ``/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb``

..

  There are two no-cost editions of GitLab.  The ``Community Edition`` (CE) and the
  ``Enterprise Edition`` (EE).  Both editions provide the same functionality but the
  Enterprise Edition allows for an easier migration path to paid-for features. These
  instructions cover the installation of the ``Community Edition`` which can be
  migrated to the Enterprise Edition if those features are needed.

  See: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/upgrading_from_ce_to_ee.html

..

  GitLab must be run from local storage (or a VM with local storage).  GitLab does not support
  and has known issues with executing from NFS mounts either hosted inside the VM or externally.

  See: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/

..

  When installing GitLab and using a HTTPS URL the following error message may be encountered::

    Running handlers:
    There was an error running gitlab-ctl reconfigure:

    letsencrypt_certificate[gitlab] (letsencrypt::http_authorization line 6) had an error: Acme::Client::Error::RejectedIdentifier:
    acme_certificate[staging] (/opt/gitlab/embedded/cookbooks/cache/cookbooks/letsencrypt/resources/certificate.rb line 41) had
    an error: Acme::Client::Error::RejectedIdentifier: Error creating new order :: Cannot issue for "gitlab": Domain name needs
    at least one dot

  The error is caused by a failure for Let's Encrypt to acquire an SSL certificate which it
  attempts to aquire during installation.  GitLab should be deployed with a valid SSL
  certificate that is implemented after installation and this error can be ignored for now.
  The installation process should generate self-signed certificates when the Let's Encrypt
  attempt fails.

  These instructions install GitLab without an SSL certificate and apply one later to
  avoid this error in the installation process.

..

  When changes are made to the configuration file ``/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`` GitLab will
  need to be reconfigured.  The command to reconfigure GitLab is::

    sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure


****************
Deployment Steps
****************

.. note::

  Instructions assume execution using the ``root`` account.

1. Connect the system to the NFS Server:

  See Guide: :doc:`../nfs/nfs-client-deployment-guide`

2. Connect the system to the IdM Server:

  See Guide: :doc:`../idm/idm-client-deployment-guide`

3. Install GitLab dependencies:

  .. code-block:: bash

    dnf -y install curl policycoreutils openssh-server perl postfix yum-utils

4. Enable OpenSSH server daemon if not enabled:

  .. note::

    Execute the following to determine if sshd is running: |br|
    ``systemctl status sshd``

  .. code-block:: bash

    systemctl enable --now sshd

5. Configure firewalld rules:

  .. note::

    Execute the following to determine if firewalld is running: |br|
    ``systemctl status firewalld``

  .. code-block:: bash

    systemctl enable --now firewalld
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service={http,https} --permanent
    firewall-cmd --reload

6. Enable Postfix::

    systemctl enable --now postfix

7. Add the GitLab package repository:

  .. danger::

    The official installation instructions call out piping the output of curl into bash which
    is a security risk.  Download ``script.rpm.sh`` first and verify its contents before executing
    the script.

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd ~
    curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.rpm.sh -o script.rpm.sh
    chmod 755 script.rpm.sh
    ./script.rpm.sh

8. Install GitLab:

  .. important::

    The ``EXTERNAL_URL`` attribute should be set to the URL that users will be using to access GitLab

  .. note::

    HTTPS will be configured following installation.

  .. code-block:: bash

    EXTERNAL_URL="http://gitlab.engwsc.example.com" dnf install -y gitlab-ce

9. Record the initial root password

  .. note::

    During deployment an initial random root password is created.  That
    initial root password is stored in a file named ``/etc/gitlab/initial_root_password``
    but the file is automatically erased 24-hours after installation.

10. Disable GitLab repositories:

  .. important::

    It is not recommended that GitLab be updated when ``dnf update`` is called.  The following step
    will disable the yum/dnf repository.  When updating GitLab the dnf/yum command will need to include
    the GitLab repository name.

  .. note::

    The following command can be used to update GitLab when the repository is disabled by default: |br|
    ``dnf -y --enablerepo=gitlab_gitlab-ce,gitlab_gitlab-ce-source update gitlab-ce``

  .. code-block:: bash

    yum-config-manager --disable gitlab_gitlab-ce
    yum-config-manager --disable gitlab_gitlab-ce-source

11. Create Self-Signed SSL Certificate:

  .. important::

    Replace values with the specifics of your network.

  .. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p /etc/gitlab/ssl
    chmod 755 /etc/gitlab/ssl

    # Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
    # State or Province Name (full name) []:New York
    # Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:New York
    # Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:engwsc
    # Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
    # Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:gitlab.engwsc.example.com
    # Email Address []:

    openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 \
        -keyout "/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.engwsc.example.com.key" \
        -out "/etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.engwsc.example.com.crt" \
        -subj "/CN=gitlab.engwsc.example.com/C=US/ST=New York/L=New York/O=engwsc" \
        -days 365

12. Set ``gitlab.rb`` options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    # Set GitLab's external URL
    sed -i "s|external_url 'http://gitlab.engwsc.example.com'|external_url 'https://gitlab.engwsc.example.com'|g" /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb

    # Disable GitLab "Usage Ping"
    sed -i "s/^.*gitlab_rails\['usage_ping_enabled'\].*$/gitlab_rails['usage_ping_enabled'] = false/g" /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb

    # Enable http to https redirects
    sed -i "s/^.*nginx\['redirect_http_to_https'\].*$/nginx['redirect_http_to_https'] = true/g" /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb

    # Disable Let's Encrypt (In-favor of Self-Signed or CA issued certs)
    sed -i "s/^.*letsencrypt\['enable'\].*$/letsencrypt['enable'] = false/g" /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb

13. Reconfigure GitLab

  .. code-block:: bash

    gitlab-ctl reconfigure

14. Setup GitLab using the Web interface:

  See Guide: :doc:`gitlab-configuration-guide`
